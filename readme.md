# Angel.co Job Finder

Takes in a person's information as a json file and matches them with jobs from Angel.co based on their perceived compatibility with the job listing.

How to use

```sh
$ ruby app.rb [user.json]
```

Sample users can be found in the /json folder

*note due to the low quantity of internship listings, greedy internship searches can take some time.*
